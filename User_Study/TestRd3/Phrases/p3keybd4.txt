the sun rises in the east
it is very windy today
do not worry about this
dashing through the snow
want to join us for lunch
stay away from strangers
accompanied by an adult
see you later alligator
make my day you sucker
I can play much better now
she wears too much makeup
my bare face in the wind
Batman wears a cape
I hate baking pies
Lydia wants to go home
