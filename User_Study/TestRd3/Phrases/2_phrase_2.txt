I took the rover from the shop
movie about a nutty professor
come and see our new car
coming up with killer sound bites
I am going to a music lesson
the opposing team is over there
soon we will return from the city
I am wearing a tie and a jacket
the quick brown fox jumped
all together in one big pile
wear a crown with many jewels
there will be some fog tonight
I am allergic to bees and peanuts
he is still on our team
the Dow Jones index has risen
