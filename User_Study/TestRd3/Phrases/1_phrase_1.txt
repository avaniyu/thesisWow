my watch fell in the water
prevailing wind from the east
never too rich and never too thin
breathing is difficult
I can see the rings on Saturn
physics and chemistry are hard
my bank account is overdrawn
elections bring out the best
we are having spaghetti
time to go shopping
a problem with the engine
elephants are afraid of mice
my favorite place to visit
three two one zero blast off
my favorite subject is psychology
