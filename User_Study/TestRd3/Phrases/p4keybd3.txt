the dog will bite you
a most ridiculous thing
where did you get that tie
what a lovely red jacket
do you like to shop on Sunday
I spilled coffee on the carpet
the largest of the five oceans
shall we play a round of cards
Olympic athletes use drugs
my mother makes good cookies
do a good deed to someone
quick there is someone knocking
flashing red light means stop
sprawling subdivisions are bad
where did I leave my glasses
