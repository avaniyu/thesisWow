the dreamers of dreams
did you have a good time
space is a high priority
you are a wonderful example
do not squander your time
do not drink too much
take a coffee break
popularity is desired by all
the music is better than it sounds
starlight and dewdrop
the living is easy
fish are jumping
the cotton is high
drove my Chevy to the levee
but the levee was dry
