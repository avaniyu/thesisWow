no more war no more bloodshed
toss the ball around
I will meet you at noon
I want to hold your hand
the children are playing
Superman never wore a mask
I listen to the tape every day
he is shouting loudly
correct your diction immediately
seasoned golfers love the game
he cooled off after she left
my dog sheds his hair
join us on the patio
these cookies are so amazing
I can still feel your presence
