		TextTest.html demonstrates how to use the TextTest C# application
		for text entry evaluation from a web page. This web page acts as
		a client, sending information to TextTest, acting as a server,
		over the WebSockets protocol. The TextTest C# application is
		responsible for generated presented phrases, receiving inputted
		characters, and writing time-stamped log files. This web page
		merely shows the presented phrases and passes through the inputted
		keystrokes to TextTest. It thereby demonstrates how to use TextTest
		from the web.

		Procedure: Run TextTest.exe and start it listening over WebSockets.
		Then click "Connect" on this web page and begin the test from within
		TextTest.exe. Presented phrases should be shown on this page. The user
		can type "Enter" at the end of each phrase or click "Next" to advance
		to the next phrase. This page requires TextTest version 2.3.1 or later.
